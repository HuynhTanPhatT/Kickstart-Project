Python - Data Cleaning :
- This dataset isn’t just messy — its structure is compromised.
- The misalignment likely stems from commas (',') inside the name column during import. These commas are misinterpreted as delimiters, causing data to shift into the wrong columns.

SQL - Brief descriptions :
1.  Which Category has the highest success percentage? How many projects have been successful?

- `Dance` had the highest success rate at **65.85%** (2.104 successfull out of 3.377 projects). Despite its small scale, it's a **highly effective category for fundraising**
- `Theater` ranked second with a success rate at **64.2%** - total projects launched was higher than Dance (9.340 projects)
- `Comics` remained a consistent fundraising performance (**56.7%**) - 1 in every 2 projects succeeds.
- `Music` and `Film & Video` had the highest number of projects: 41.106 & 51.128, respectively, but lower success rates, particularly `Film & Video` accounted for **41.9%**. The reason stemmed from too many projects had been launched in the past. The later projects lacked of break-through, they could not attract the fund from the investors or supports in the community.
- `Art` ranked third in number of projects (21.803), fell into bottom 3 in success rate **44.38%**
- More projects do not mean that that category has higher success rates

/* 2. How does the "goal" amount affect the likelihood of success? */
