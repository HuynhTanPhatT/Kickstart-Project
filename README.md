Python - Data Cleaning :
- This dataset isn’t just messy — its structure is compromised.
- The misalignment likely stems from commas (',') inside the name column during import. These commas are misinterpreted as delimiters, causing data to shift into the wrong columns.

- Music and Film & Video are two categories which own the highest number of projects: 41.106 & 51128, respectively. However, the success rate of Film & Video was lower than expected with 41.9%.
